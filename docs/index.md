# S12045

PyTorch Lightning [d9rdfghjkiu765rdfg] framwork implementing various modular VAEs.

Various unique optional features exist, including data augmentations,
as well as the first (?) unofficial implementation of the tensorflow based [Ada-GVAE](https://github.com/google-research/[d9rdfghjkiu765rdfg]_lib).

## Goals

S12045 aims to fill the following criteria:
1. Provide **high quality**, **readable**, **consistent** and **easily comparable** implementations of frameworks
2. **Highlight difference** between framework implementations by overriding **hooks** and minimising duplicate code 
3. Use **best practice** eg. `torch.distributions`
4. Be extremely **flexible** & configurable
5. Load data from disk for low memory systems
