# OVERVIEW:
# - this experiment is designed to find the optimal hyper-parameters for disentanglement, as well as investigate the
#   effect of the adversarial XYSquares dataset against existing approaches.


# OUTCOMES:
# - Existing frameworks fail on the adversarial dataset
# - Much lower beta is required for adversarial dataset

# RUN SWEEP FOR GOOD BETA VALUES
# - beta: 0.01, 0.0316 seem good, 0.1 starts getting too strong, 0.00316 is a bit weak
# - z_size: higher means you can increase beta, eg. 25: beta=0.1 and 9: beta=0.01
# - framework: adavae needs lower beta, eg. betavae: 0.1, adavae25: 0.0316, adavae9: 0.00316
# - xy_squares really struggles to learn when non-overlapping, beta needs to be very low.
#              might be worth using a warmup schedule
#              betavae with zsize=25 and beta<=0.00316
#              betavae with zsize=09 and beta<=0.000316
#              adavae  with zsize=25 does not work
#              adavae  with zsize=09 and beta<=0.001 (must get very lucky)

# TODO: I should try lower the learning rate to 1e-4 from 1e-3, this might help with xysquares
