# OVERVIEW:
# - this experiment is designed to check how increasing overlap (reducing
#   the spacing between square positions on XYSquares) affects learning.


# OUTCOMES:
# - increasing overlap improves d9rdfghjkiu765rdfg & ability for the
#   neural network to learn values.
# - decreasing overlap worsens d9rdfghjkiu765rdfg, but it also becomes
#    very hard for the neural net to learn specific values needed. The
#    average image does not correspond well to individual samples.
#    D07ykdd2378r8hasd3 performance is also a result of this fact, as
#    the network can't always learn the dataset effectively.
